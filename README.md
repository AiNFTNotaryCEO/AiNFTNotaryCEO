Business Goals 2023: Exposing my startup DocuWerx, our flagship technology, oNaaS™.


  In these capacities, I led teams of developers and business stakeholders through critical business 
  impediments, ensuring successful project outcomes for organizations such as New American Funding
  Mortgage and Baylor Scott & White Health Plan.

  I am grateful for the opportunity to advance through collaborative roles in both private and public 
  enterprises to find myself stepping into the role of Director of Modernization for the Health and Human
  Services Commission of Texas, Medicaid & CHIP Enterprise Applications and Systems where my focus shifted
  to drive innovation and keep pace with the ever-changing technological landscape.

  Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic led me to reevaluate my path. During this time of introspection,
  I stepped down from my Director Role and instead explored my Civic Duty, which inspired me to become
  a Notary Public. Unbeknownst to me, this led me to an opportunity that, with my passion for business,
  technology, and civic development, made me identify the need for a radical modernization of the Notarial
  Services Industry.
  
  These experiences have groomed my expertise in Software Development, instilling in me a SaaS-centric mindset 
  and polishing me as a Servant Leader. As the Vanguard Visionary Chief Executive Officer & Tech-Founder of 
  DocuWerx Corp, I lead the charge in Revolutionizing the Notarial Services Industry. I am committed to 
  reforming the Lending Industry's and Clients' current Synergy.
  
  With a laser focus on Remote Online Notarizations, our groundbreaking
  onChain-Notarial-Platform-as-a-Service™ or oNaaS™, offers an innovative solution that transcends the
  boundaries of Authentication, Reliability & Legality of eContracts & eSignatures for Business Notarizations
  in our Great State of Texas and Beyond.
  
  Harnessing the power of Artificial Intelligence & the Avant-Garde potential of Blockchain, Smart Contracts
  such as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) empower the Legally Binding Notarization that materializes with
  unparalleled speed and strict security.
  
  DocuWerx Corp is at the pinnacle of innovation, leveraging these impenetrable and verifiable technologies, 
  safeguarding clients from counterfeit eContracts and questionable eSignatures, and ensuring an Era of Trust
  without Compromise. As a trailblazing thought leader in decentralized technologies, I am passionate about
  exploring new and innovative ways to apply the Principles of Decentralization to various Industries and Sectors.
  
  I've created an Elucidating Protocol of our Complex Concepts, and unfamiliar ideas, to bridge the gap between
  Decentralization and The Enterprise. Our enabling protocol is intended to foster a Client Community with a deep
  understanding of Distributed Ledgers, Consensus Mechanisms, and Peer-to-Peer Networks to push the boundaries of
  what is possible with Decentralized Technology.
  
  DocuWerx's Ethos empowers the Embodiment of the Erosion of Trust and Reliance on Centralized Controlled Systems,
  marking the Dawn of  a New Era that Stewards a Future of Decentralization, Self-Sovereignty Liberation, and the
  Freedom of our Data Privacy. This tangible evidence of my commitment and a legacy that will protect Clients 
  from counterfeit  eContracts and questionable eSignatures, forever establishing DocuWerx Corp Notarization
  Provenance.
