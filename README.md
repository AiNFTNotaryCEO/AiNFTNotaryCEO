Business Goals 2023: Exposing my startup DocuWerx, our flagship technology, oNaaS™.


Combining over a decade-long tenure in Software Development & Agile Methodologies through collaborative roles
in the Private and Public Enterprises' corporate ladders. I have accumulated a bolstered array of certifications
across Business Analysis, Scrum Mastery, SAFE®, AI, Blockchain & Smart Contracts, further systematically enriching
my software development understanding. 

Throughout my career, I have successfully led development teams and business stakeholders to overcome complex
impediments and deliver innovative solutions. I have worked with prestige organizations such as The Health and
Human Services Commission of Texas, Centene Corp, and New American Funding.

DocuWerx Corp is poised at the forefront of avant-garde solutions anchored in developing at unparalleled speed
and stringent measures for legally binding notarizations. Combating counterfeit contracts, questionable signatures,
and fraudulent identities. 

With a laser focus on developing the next evolution of Remote Online Notarizations, I became the leading architect
of our flagship technology, I proudly introduce onChain-Notarial-Platform-as-a-Service™ (oNaaS™). The pinnacle of
innovation transcending today’s contract and signature authenticity accomplishments, adding to the peaked ceilings
new heights with Blockchain structures, Artificial Intelligence, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).

As the Vanguard Tech Founder and Chief Executive Officer, I initiated a radical modernization through decentralized
technologies that underpin the ethos within my SaaS organization — leading the charge in revolutionizing the Notarial
Services Industry to cement DocuWerx Corp Notarization Provenance.
