- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate desmystifying the block
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with the revieew the Smart Contract Reasearch Forum, SporosDAO, and Ethereum Foundation and for that i dont need code. . . 
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about non superficial genuine questions that dont start with tradional ice breakers
